## Material for a course on MarkDown, GitHub pages &amp; GitHub wikis

1. Learners will first learn basic Markdown by "live-coding" a basic page
2. Then we take the lessons learned to create an "index.md" page to be the sites Homepage
3. Create a gh-pages branch for our web-site along with an images folder with some
example graphics
4. Next we explore the Repository settings page and locate the github page URL and add it 
to the Repo landing page. Click on it and inspect our new homepage of our static web-site.
5. Return to settings and explore the default Jekyll page themes
6. Add more markdown pages and link to them (including some external links and linking to 
the 'local' image files
7. Move onto the [wiki page](https://github.com/mfernandes61/github_web_course/wiki) and learn about creating wikis from the material there (with more live-coding).   

## Pre-requisites & equipment
- We will use the web interface for these lessons so knowledge of Command-line git is not 
required (but may still be advantageous).
- Learners should register at Github to get a username and have (or have access to) a 
computer with a web browser.
- An Etherpad (an electronic class whiteboard) may be useful for storing questions to be answered
at a later more convenient point. You can create one (for free) here: https://etherpad.net
- Projector attached to Instructors laptop, a white-board & pens and red/green post-its (for
Learners to request aid or indicate completion of exercises) will also be useful.
